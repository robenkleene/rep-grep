markdown-syntax.md:47:Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted

markdown-syntax.md:108:Note that Markdown formatting syntax is not processed within block-level
markdown-syntax.md:109:HTML tags. E.g., you can't use Markdown-style `*emphasis*` inside an
markdown-syntax.md:113:used anywhere in a Markdown paragraph, list item, or header. If you
markdown-syntax.md:114:want, you can even use HTML tags instead of Markdown formatting; e.g. if

markdown-syntax.md:546:Markdown supports two style of links: *inline* and *reference*.

markdown-syntax.md:842:Markdown supports a shortcut style for creating "automatic" links for URLs and email addresses: simply surround the URL or email address with angle brackets. What this means is that if you want to show the actual text of a URL or email address, and also have it be a clickable link, you can do this:
markdown-syntax.md:846:Markdown will turn this into:
