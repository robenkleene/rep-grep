markdown-syntax.md:34:**Note:** This document is itself written using Markup; you
markdown-syntax.md:45:Markup is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.
markdown-syntax.md:47:Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markup-formatted
markdown-syntax.md:50:Markup's syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML
markdown-syntax.md:53:inspiration for Markup's syntax is the format of plain text email.
markdown-syntax.md:62:To this end, Markup's syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation
markdown-syntax.md:65:look like \*emphasis\*. Markup lists look like, well, lists. Even
markdown-syntax.md:73:Markup's syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a
markdown-syntax.md:76:Markup is not a replacement for HTML, or even close to it. Its
markdown-syntax.md:80:insert. The idea for Markup is to make it easy to read, write, and
markdown-syntax.md:81:edit prose. HTML is a *publishing* format; Markup is a *writing*
markdown-syntax.md:82:format. Thus, Markup's formatting syntax only addresses issues that
markdown-syntax.md:85:For any markup that is not covered by Markup's syntax, you simply
markdown-syntax.md:87:indicate that you're switching from Markup to HTML; you just use
markdown-syntax.md:93:not be indented with tabs or spaces. Markup is smart enough not
markdown-syntax.md:96:For example, to add an HTML table to a Markup article:
markdown-syntax.md:108:Note that Markup formatting syntax is not processed within block-level
markdown-syntax.md:109:HTML tags. E.g., you can't use Markup-style `*emphasis*` inside an
markdown-syntax.md:113:used anywhere in a Markup paragraph, list item, or header. If you
markdown-syntax.md:114:want, you can even use HTML tags instead of Markup formatting; e.g. if
markdown-syntax.md:115:you'd prefer to use HTML `<a>` or `<img>` tags instead of Markup's
markdown-syntax.md:118:Unlike block-level HTML tags, Markup syntax *is* processed within
markdown-syntax.md:144:Markup allows you to use these characters naturally, taking care of
markdown-syntax.md:153:and Markup will leave it alone. But if you write:
markdown-syntax.md:157:Markup will translate it to:
markdown-syntax.md:161:Similarly, because Markup supports [inline HTML](#html), if you use
markdown-syntax.md:162:angle brackets as delimiters for HTML tags, Markup will treat them as
markdown-syntax.md:167:Markup will translate it to:
markdown-syntax.md:171:However, inside Markup code spans and blocks, angle brackets and
markdown-syntax.md:173:Markup to write about HTML code. (As opposed to raw HTML, which is a
markdown-syntax.md:192:that Markup supports "hard-wrapped" text paragraphs. This differs
markdown-syntax.md:197:When you *do* want to insert a `<br />` break tag using Markup, you
markdown-syntax.md:201:"every line break is a `<br />`" rule wouldn't work for Markup.
markdown-syntax.md:202:Markup's email-style [blockquoting][bq] and multi-paragraph [list items][l]
markdown-syntax.md:212:Markup supports two styles of headers, [Setext] [1] and [atx] [2].
markdown-syntax.md:249:Markup uses email-style `>` characters for blockquoting. If you're
markdown-syntax.md:251:know how to create a blockquote in Markup. It looks best if you hard
markdown-syntax.md:261:Markup allows you to be lazy and only put the `>` before the first

markdown-syntax.md:299:Markup supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.
markdown-syntax.md:327:list have no effect on the HTML output Markup produces. The HTML
markdown-syntax.md:328:Markup produces from the above list is:
markdown-syntax.md:336:If you instead wrote the list in Markup like this:
markdown-syntax.md:349:you can use ordinal numbers in your ordered Markup lists, so that
markdown-syntax.md:354:list with the number 1. At some point in the future, Markup may support
markdown-syntax.md:377:If list items are separated by blank lines, Markup will wrap the
markdown-syntax.md:418:paragraphs, but here again, Markup will allow you to be
markdown-syntax.md:461:of a code block are interpreted literally. Markup wraps a code block
markdown-syntax.md:464:To produce a code block in Markup, simply indent every line of the
markdown-syntax.md:471:Markup will generate:
markdown-syntax.md:501:easy to include example HTML source code using Markup -- just paste
markdown-syntax.md:502:it and indent it, and Markup will handle the hassle of encoding the
markdown-syntax.md:516:Regular Markup syntax is not processed within code blocks. E.g.,
markdown-syntax.md:518:it's also easy to use Markup to write about Markup's own syntax.
markdown-syntax.md:546:Markup supports two style of links: *inline* and *reference*.
markdown-syntax.md:602:**Note:** There is a known bug in Markup.pl 1.0.1 which prevents
markdown-syntax.md:615:Link definitions are only used for creating links during Markup
markdown-syntax.md:647:Link definitions can be placed anywhere in your Markup document. I
markdown-syntax.md:678:Markup's inline link style:
markdown-syntax.md:692:With Markup's reference-style links, a source document much more
markdown-syntax.md:701:Markup treats asterisks (`*`) and underscores (`_`) as indicators of
markdown-syntax.md:779:tags. Markup will turn this:
markdown-syntax.md:803:Markup uses an image syntax that is intended to resemble the syntax
markdown-syntax.md:830:As of this writing, Markup has no syntax for specifying the
markdown-syntax.md:842:Markup supports a shortcut style for creating "automatic" links for URLs and email addresses: simply surround the URL or email address with angle brackets. What this means is that if you want to show the actual text of a URL or email address, and also have it be a clickable link, you can do this:
markdown-syntax.md:846:Markup will turn this into:
markdown-syntax.md:851:Markup will also perform a bit of randomized decimal and hex
markdown-syntax.md:853:spambots. For example, Markup will turn this:
markdown-syntax.md:875:Markup allows you to use backslash escapes to generate literal
markdown-syntax.md:876:characters which would otherwise have special meaning in Markup's
markdown-syntax.md:883:Markup provides backslash escapes for the following characters:
