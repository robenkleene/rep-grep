-Markdown's syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a
 format for *writing* for the web.
 
-Markdown is not a replacement for HTML, or even close to it. Its
 syntax is very small, corresponding only to a very small subset of
 HTML tags. The idea is *not* to create a syntax that makes it easier
 to insert HTML tags. In my opinion, HTML tags are already easy to
-insert. The idea for Markdown is to make it easy to read, write, and
-edit prose. HTML is a *publishing* format; Markdown is a *writing*
-format. Thus, Markdown's formatting syntax only addresses issues that
 can be conveyed in plain text.
 
-For any markup that is not covered by Markdown's syntax, you simply
 use HTML itself. There's no need to preface it or delimit it to
-indicate that you're switching from Markdown to HTML; you just use
 the tags.
 
 The only restrictions are that block-level HTML elements -- e.g. `<div>`,
 `<table>`, `<pre>`, `<p>`, etc. -- must be separated from surrounding
 content by blank lines, and the start and end tags of the block should
-not be indented with tabs or spaces. Markdown is smart enough not
 to add extra (unwanted) `<p>` tags around HTML block-level tags.
