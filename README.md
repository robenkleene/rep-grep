# Rep

`rep` is a command-line utility that takes [`grep`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep)-formatted lines via standard input, and performs a find-and-replace on the matches. By default, it outputs a [`diff`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff)-preview of the changes to standard output, and with a flag it can write the changes to the files in place.

## Simple Example

Output a diff to standard output replacing `foo` with `bar`:

```
grep -n foo *` | rep foo bar
```

Add the `-w` flag to write the changes to the files in place:

```
grep -n foo *` | rep foo bar -w
```

The `-n` (`--line-number`) option is required so that `grep` outputs the line number for each match.

## Writing by Editing Standard Input

Like [`wgrep`](https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep) for Emacs, writing to files can also be accomplished by editing the contents of the `grep` output itself (and omitting the find and replace arguments).

This means for example a workflow like this will work:

1. `grep -n foo * > tmp`
2. `sed -i '' s/foo/bar/g tmp`
3. `rep < tmp`
4. `rep -w < tmp`

## Flow

The flow `rep` uses when making a change looks like this:

1. The input line is broken up into these parts: `<file-path>:<line-number>:[<column-number>:]<line-content>`.
2. The the substitution (e.g., the first and second [find and replace] arguments) are applied to the `<line-contents>`.
3. The result is written to the `<file-path>`.

These means editing standard input first, and then applying a find and replace to the resulting grep-formatted lines, will work.

## Installation

`rep` is available via [`cargo`](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo):

```
cargo install rep-grep
```

## Configuration

The default pager is `less`, the `REP_PAGER` environment variable can be used to override the pager (e.g., `export REP_PAGER=delta` in Bash).

## Help

`rep -h` (or `rep --help`, `--help` provides slightly longer explanations of some options) will list help for all the command-line flags.

## Acknowledgements

- `rep` was inspired by [`wgrep`](https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep) for Emacs, which allows editing `grep` results in an Emacs buffer and then writing those changes to the source files.
- Much of the functionality, and the overall structure of the source code, was borrowed [`sd`](https://github.com/chmln/sd). `rep` began as a fork of `sd`.
- The code for specifying a custom pager for `rep` was borrowed from [`delta`](https://github.com/dandavison/delta).
